Simple project that processes images using the pytesseract and OpenCV libraries and extracts text as word lists from images. Backend is written in Python within Flask Framework, which sends the extracted data to Angular Frontend in the form of a list of words that can be searched within and when you click on it, the program shades the word above the image.
