Simple project that processes images using the **pytesseract** and **OpenCV** libraries and extracts text as word lists from images. Backend is written in **Python** within **Flask** Framework, which sends the extracted data to **Angular** Frontend in the form of a list of words that can be searched within and when you click on it, the program shades the word above the image.
